[23:45]Malinoric: If you're taking feedback, the only problematic locations are places without any buildings as easy reference. Foliage often looks very different between the game visual and what you see on the minimap.
[23:45]Malinoric: so desert, piscatoris, haunted woods... those places.
[23:46]Malinoric: kharazi is a particular nightmare, but the positions are a lot more lenient in that case, so it isn't as much of an issue
