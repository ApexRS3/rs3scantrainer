Planned for next release (b0.4):

- Map Entities
    - Rendering for zoom level changes needs massive optimization
        - Invisible from certain zoom

- Path Editor
    - Add support for the model refinement (target entity, to_text etc)
    - Add proper entity interactions now that steps are MapEntities
    - [Bug] Escape key cancels the entire editor when redrawing ability and in other situations
    - [Bug] Fit to step/path doesnt include level
    - [Bug] Scroll bleeding through: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73195855/mouse-scroll-affects-underlying-map-instead-of-leaflet-custom-control
    - Add a way to make it not closeable by the user
    - [Bug] Teleport overriding does not work

- Shortcuts & Teleports:
    - Combine into a combined abstract data structure


- Solving Behaviour
    - Path Panel
        - Neat step styling
        - Add icon for orientation step
        - Focus section when selected
        - [WIP] Detail tooltip on hover
            - Finish official info
            - Add custom description
        - Disable default teleport render when contained in step
            - Render step instead
            - (Maybe that's not even necessary, since the step graphics are draw on top of the teleport graphics. Very hacky, but does what it should)
        - Cleanup using "fake" steps:
            - Combine surges/dives following a powerburst into one "fake" step
            - Duplicate shortcut step to exist in both sections
            - Combine run followed by shortcut into one

- [Tooling] Add a permanent tile highlight when moving the mouse over the map
- Lumbridge Caves: A, B and C are at floor 2, not 0. Check whether that checks out ingame
- Fix floor of Dorgesh Khaan spot E
- Update Deep Wildy Scan/Wilderness Crater
- Update compass spots from rsmv
- Have a way to directly link to a given clue and its method with query parameters.
- Shortcut editor
- The internal datastructure for clues has been revamped and now includes more detail about the individual steps.
- OverviewLayer/theorycrafter
    - You can edit methods locally, share them as content packs.

RELEASE 1.0
- Auto read pulses
- [Tech] Overlay pathing into the game.
    - If this works, it is HUGE. Idea: Fix Camera distance and height by zooming out and clicking the compass, then calibrate camera transform using a suitable environment, Falador party room might actually be great.
    - Player position is input explicitly by placing a marker on the map.
    - This should be enough to draw polygons into the world as long as the camera height is not modified.
    - Yaw can be read by the compass on the minimap.
    - Camera orientation/position: Developer console 'getcamerapos'.
      Format:  floor,chunkx,chunkz,subx,subz


Unscheduled (Far future):
- Fade teleport icons when on different level
- [What] Incorporate jacket/backpack recommmendations
- [What] Add explanations describing the exact spot (Superscript Question Mark maybe?)
- Add a view to see the entire scan tree without having to enter the editor
- Add some kind of discord integration with Fairy Nuff (Mike, if you stumble upon this: I have some ideas :) )
- Scale teleports with zoom
- Integrate a solving method for compasses. (This is important because having both solvers open takes up too much screen.)
- Better algorithm to combine equivalence classes.
- Better algorithm to construct polygon for equivalence class (with hole support).
- Add puzzle solvers
- Warn when not using meerkats
- Track Jacket/Backpack Charges via Chat, display them
- Figure out z-Ordering of layers (need to use custom panes maybe)
- Landing areas for non-static teleports, show better metadata on tooltip/hover
